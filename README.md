# ML-vis
Final project for Advanced Data Visualization

## Summary
My final project aims to be an interactive exploration of neural networks using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset as the medium through which this exploration takes place. Users can: 
1. select different model types to explore
2. build, train, and evaluate the performance of the model
3. peer into the inner workings of the network by visualizing what’s happening with the first layer nodes
4. draw their own digits and get real-time feedback of the model’s predictions
All of these features combine to give the user a lightweight, interactive and exploratory introduction to neural nets that will hopefully spur on an ongoing interest in the topic.
